# Welcome to Decentralized payment
A decentralized multichain payment gateway mechanism refers to a system that enables the seamless transfer of value across multiple blockchain networks in a decentralized manner. It acts as a bridge between different blockchain platforms, allowing users to transact using various cryptocurrencies or tokens.
D-Pay is a unified payment getaway that gives us a seamless, secure, and decentralize gateway with end-to-end analytics.
Let's have one [live Demo](https://bafybeiafh7aqvx26ca4it7qm227uxw7zkhqo37asoa2q2526j2quost3fe.ipfs.gateway.valist.io/#/)

# Problem statement
For any B2C business, to receive a payment of any type, some form of gateway is required. But all the service providers are completely centralized and always track all the transactions. That is happening in the business.

To reduce this hassle, dePay plays a key role to get transactions completed without any central authority to confirm or track the transactions. These centralized systems have complete data from their users to their requirements and the data of the business itself.
